"""Credential storage layer for claude-swap.

Owns *where* credentials live and *how* they are read/written — the macOS
Keychain-vs-file routing, per-process capability detection and sticky fallback,
and the ``.enc``-wins backup reconciliation that landed in #66. Split out of
``switcher.py`` so the switcher reads as account orchestration again.

``CredentialStore`` is a leaf collaborator: it imports only the OS-primitive and
path helpers (``macos_keychain``, ``paths``) and never imports ``switcher``. It
reads its live configuration (``platform``, ``_logger``, ``credentials_dir``)
from a host *view* — a small data-only window onto the switcher that constructs
it — and must never call a switcher *method* through that host, or storage and
orchestration would re-couple. The store owns only its two pieces of state:
``_keychain_usable_cache`` (sticky, process-local) and
``_last_active_credentials_backend`` (for the post-switch follow-up message).
